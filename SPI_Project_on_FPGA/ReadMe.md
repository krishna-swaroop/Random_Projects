# Ambient Light Sensor Project with SPI on FPGA

  This project is based on a tutorial by Nandland. The code has been borrowed from the tutorial with minor changes.
  The HDL code is writen specifically for GoBoard, a hobbyist FPGA board distributed by nandland.com
  This implementation uses the PMOD interface provided by the board as an SPI outlet to communicate with the 7 segment display.
