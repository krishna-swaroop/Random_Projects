# DIY Oscilloscope 
  This is a writeup for the Oscilloscope part of the Portable Electronics Workbench I'm working on.

## Working
  This module utilises an Arduino and RPi in conjunction to act as an oscilloscope. It utilises the ADC of the Arduino to transmit data to the RPi. A program has been developed using PyGame to visualise this data. This python script can be run on the RPi whenever the oscilloscope is to be used. Taken from a tutorial in Pi magazine
